# Day 10: Monitoring Station

 [See it on github](https://github.com/multitudes/Advent-of-Code-2019)
   
You fly into the asteroid belt and reach the Ceres monitoring station. The Elves here have an emergency: they're having trouble tracking all of the asteroids and can't be sure they're safe.

The Elves would like to build a new monitoring station in a nearby area of space; they hand you a map of all of the asteroids in that region (your puzzle input).

Find the best location for a new monitoring station. How many other asteroids can be detected from that location?
